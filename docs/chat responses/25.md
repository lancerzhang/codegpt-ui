In Angular, if you navigate from one route to another with the same route component (e.g., `chat/1` to `chat/2`), Angular reuses the route component instead of destroying and recreating it. This is done for performance reasons, and it's part of Angular's default route reuse strategy.

However, this behavior means that lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit()` aren't called again when you navigate from `chat/1` to `chat/2`.

To react to changes in route parameters, you can subscribe to the `params` or `paramMap` observable of the `ActivatedRoute`. Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  // your component metadata here
})
export class ChatWindowComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.paramMap.pipe(
      switchMap(params => {
        const conversationId = +params.get('conversationId'); // the '+' operator converts the string to a number
        // fetch data based on conversationId here
      })
    ).subscribe();
  }
}
```

In this example, the `switchMap` operator is used to switch the outer observable (the `paramMap`) to a new inner observable that you define. The `switchMap` operator also has the advantage of cancelling any previous inner observable when the `paramMap` changes, which helps prevent race conditions if your data fetching is asynchronous.
