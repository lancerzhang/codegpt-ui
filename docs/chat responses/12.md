Angular is a browser-based framework and does not have direct access to the file system. Therefore, to read JSON files, you typically place them in the assets folder and fetch them via HTTP. 

To do this, you first need to import the `HttpClient` module into your service:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
```

Then, inject it into your constructor:

```typescript
constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }
```

You can then use the `http.get()` method to fetch the JSON data:

```typescript
private getJsonData(filePath: string): Observable<any> {
  return this.http.get(filePath);
}
```

Please make sure that the JSON files are placed in the `assets` folder of your Angular application. Then, in the `jsonFile1`, `jsonFile2`, and `jsonFile3` variables, set the paths to the JSON files relative to the `assets` folder, like so:

```typescript
const jsonFile1 = 'assets/file1.json';
const jsonFile2 = 'assets/file2.json';
const jsonFile3 = 'assets/file3.json';
```

Remember to add `HttpClientModule` to the `imports` array in your AppModule (typically located in `app.module.ts`):

```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [...],
  imports: [
    ...,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [...],
  bootstrap: [...]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Note: HTTP requests are asynchronous, and as such, they return an Observable. You can use the `subscribe()` method on the component side to handle the response.
