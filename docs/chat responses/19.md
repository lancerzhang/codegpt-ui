In order to store the created time for messages and last modified time for conversations, we need to update our service methods accordingly.

Let's update the `saveMessage` and `saveConversation` methods in `chat-db.service.ts`:

```typescript
async saveMessage(conversationId: number, message: { text: string, sender: string, createdAt?: Date }) {
    message['conversationId'] = conversationId;
    message['createdAt'] = new Date(); // Storing the creation timestamp
    return await this.messages.add(message);
}

async saveConversation(conversation: { title: string, lastUpdatedAt?: Date }) {
    conversation['lastUpdatedAt'] = new Date(); // Storing the modification timestamp
    return await this.conversations.add(conversation);
}
```

In your `saveMessage` method, we've added an `createdAt` property to the `message` object and assigned the current timestamp using `new Date()`. Similarly, in `saveConversation` method, we've added a `lastUpdatedAt` property to the `conversation` object.

Now, whenever a message is saved, the current timestamp will be stored as its creation time. Similarly, whenever a conversation is updated, the current timestamp will be stored as its last update time.

Please note that you would also need to update the interfaces/types for `Message` and `Conversation` to include these new properties. The updated interfaces would look something like:

```typescript
interface Message {
    text: string;
    sender: string;
    conversationId: number;
    createdAt: Date;
}

interface Conversation {
    title: string;
    lastUpdatedAt: Date;
}
```

You'll need to replace the current `Message` and `Conversation` interfaces with these updated ones where they are used in your application.
