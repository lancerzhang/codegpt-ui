If you're looking to extract the "content" property from your JSON data, you can directly access the property in your `map` function. From your JSON structure, you can access it with `data.data.choices[0].message.content`.

Modify your `getJsonData` method as follows:

```typescript
private getJsonData(filePath: string): Observable<string> {
  return this.http.get(filePath).pipe(map((data: any) => data.data.choices[0].message.content));
}
```

This will extract the "content" property from the response and convert it to an Observable of string, which can be returned from your `getResponse` method. 

Please note that this assumes the structure of your JSON data is always as provided, with the "content" property always existing at the path `data.data.choices[0].message.content`. If the structure could vary or the "content" property might not always exist, you would need to add checks to prevent trying to access properties of `undefined`.
